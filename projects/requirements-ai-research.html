          <h2 id="research-overview">Overview</h2>
          <p>
            This research project examines how traditional
            requirements-driven development practices interact with
            prompt-driven, AI-assisted code generation. I compared workflows
            where requirements lead and guide implementation versus those where
            large language models generate code directly from high-level
            prompts.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="research-problem">
          <h2 id="research-problem">Problem</h2>
          <p>
            As teams increasingly experiment with AI-assisted development, it is
            easy for requirements discipline to erode. When code can be
            generated quickly from prompts, there is a risk that important
            quality attributes, constraints, and stakeholder needs get lost or
            only discovered late in the process. I wanted to understand how much
            this shift actually affects the resulting systems.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="research-approach">
          <h2 id="research-approach">Approach</h2>
          <p>
            I designed an empirical study that compared multiple AI models and
            workflows against established requirements engineering standards.
            For each scenario, I captured both the requirements artifacts and
            the resulting code, then evaluated them using ISO/IEC 25010 quality
            attributes and IEEE 830 / ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 guidance.
          </p>

              Defined repeatable prompts and requirements sets for comparing
              workflows.

              Analyzed differences in how requirements were reflected or
              dropped in AI-generated implementations.

        <section aria-labelledby="research-decisions">
          <h2 id="research-decisions">Key findings &amp; tradeoffs</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Pure prompt-driven workflows can yield impressive prototypes
              quickly but often under-specify edge cases and non-functional
              requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Combining structured requirements with AI assistance tends to
              produce more maintainable designs, at the cost of slower initial
              iteration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Clear traceability from requirement to code remains valuable, even
              when LLMs accelerate implementation.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="research-learned">What I learned</h2>
          <p>
            This work strengthened my belief that AI tools are most effective
            when anchored by thoughtful requirements and human judgment. It also
            gave me language and frameworks for talking about software quality
            beyond just \"does it work,\" which I now bring into my own projects
            and collaborations.
