          <p>
            Petfolio is a cross-platform Flutter application that helps
            households coordinate pet care. It provides a shared source of truth
            for routines, responsibilities, and handoffs so that feeding,
            medication, and other care tasks are clear, even when multiple
            people are involved.
          </p>

        <section aria-labelledby="petfolio-problem">
          <h2 id="petfolio-problem">Problem</h2>
          <p>
            In many homes, pet care is shared across family members, roommates,
            or pet sitters. Information about schedules and responsibilities is
            often scattered across text threads, sticky notes, or memory, which
            makes it easy to miss doses, double-feed, or lose context when
            someone new steps in to help.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="petfolio-approach">
          <h2 id="petfolio-approach">Approach</h2>
          <p>
            I designed Petfolio as a shared, structured view of each pet’s care
            plan. Flutter provides a single codebase for iOS and Android, while
            Firebase powers authentication, real-time data, and notifications.
            I used Riverpod for state management and a repository pattern to
            keep UI, business logic, and persistence concerns clearly separated.

        <section aria-labelledby="petfolio-decisions">
          <h2 id="petfolio-decisions">Key decisions &amp; tradeoffs</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Chose Firebase to prioritize iteration speed and built-in offline
              support over full control of backend infrastructure.
            </li>
            <li>
              Modeled users, pets, and care plans explicitly in Firestore to
              keep access control and sharing rules understandable at a glance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Focused v1 on core routines and handoffs, intentionally deferring
              advanced analytics and complex reporting to future iterations.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="petfolio-learned">What I learned</h2>
          <p>
            This project sharpened my ability to design data models that balance
            day-to-day usability with long-term maintainability. It also forced
            me to think carefully about offline behavior, notifications, and
            role-based access in a consumer-facing context.
